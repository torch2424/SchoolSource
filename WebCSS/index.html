        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my Home page. I am a part time instructor at <a href="http://www.csulb.edu">CSULB</a>.
                  I also
                  graduated from CSULB in the Business Department. I have been here for about 15 years. I started out teaching CECS 110
        and from that course I developed CECS 200 because of the interest in strictly Web design. The course has been added as part of the requirements for a minor and certificate in Web Technology and Literacy along with the CECS 110 course.  I just finished my Masters degree in Educational Technology in 2006, which I completed completely online. </p>
        <p>I am married and have
          a son who is 16 yrs old and a daughter who is 10.   My son is in high school and my daughter is in 5th grade. They both keep me busy along with our 3 dogs and 2 cats. We are an adventuresome family and enjoy going on trips.. Our family loves to go boating at <a href="http://www.nacimientoresort.com/">Lake
            Nacimiento</a> and in the winter we spend a lot of time at <a href="http://www.mammoth-mtn.com">Mammoth
              Mountain.</a></p>

        <h3>What is Local On-line?</h3>
        <p>A Local  Online Class (LOC) is a course offering in which the majority of the  instruction occurs when the student and instructor are not in the same  place.&#160; A Local Online Course uses Academic Technology to mediate most  teaching and learning, but it may require up to two hours of face-to-face  meetings per unit on the California   State University,  Long Beach  campus within the given semester.&#160; These face-to-face class meetings may  be used for activities such as orientation, special in-class presentations,  exams, or other in-class proofs of competency. </p>
